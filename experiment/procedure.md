## Procedure

Please follow these steps to do the real experiment.

#### 2. Equipment and Materials:

- Fermentor vessel (glass or stainless steel)
- Stirring mechanism or impeller
- Temperature control system (heating or cooling)
- pH control system (pH meter and controller)
- Substrate/feed solution
- Microorganism or culture
- Inoculation loop or syringe
- Sampling tools (sterile pipettes or syringes)
- Incubator (if necessary)
- Analytical instruments for measuring parameters (e.g., pH meter, spectrophotometer)

#### Preparation:

-Prepare the fermentation medium according to the specific requirements of your experiment. This may involve dissolving substrates, adjusting pH, and sterilizing the medium.<br>
-Sterilize the fermentor vessel, impeller, and any other equipment that will come in contact with the fermentation medium. Autoclaving is a common method of sterilization.<br>
-Inoculate the fermentor vessel with the desired microorganism or culture. This can be done by transferring a small amount of the culture using a sterile loop or syringe.<br>
-Ensure that the stirring mechanism, temperature control system, and pH control system are properly connected and ready for operation.<br>
### Fermentation Experiment:
-Transfer the sterilized fermentation medium to the fermentor vessel, leaving enough headspace for foaming and agitation.<br>
-Start the stirring mechanism at a predetermined speed to provide adequate mixing and aeration.<br>
-Set the desired temperature for the fermentation and allow the system to equilibrate.<br>
-Adjust the pH to the desired level using the pH control system, if necessary.<br>
-Monitor and record the fermentation parameters such as pH, temperature, agitation speed, and dissolved oxygen concentration at regular intervals.<br>
-Take samples from the fermentor vessel at specified time points for analysis. The frequency of sampling depends on the specific experiment and fermentation kinetics.<br>
-Analyze the samples for various parameters of interest, such as cell concentration, product concentration, nutrient utilization, pH, or any other relevant variables.<br>
-If necessary, make adjustments to the fermentation conditions (e.g., pH control, nutrient addition) based on the measured parameters<br>

### Post-Experiment:
-Analyze and interpret the collected data, comparing it with the expected outcomes or previous research.<br>
-Calculate relevant fermentation parameters, such as growth rate, yield, productivity, or specific rates, depending on your experiment goals.<br>
-Draw conclusions based on the results and discuss any insights or observations.<br>
### Clean-up:
-After the experiment is complete, discard any remaining fermentation medium following proper disposal guidelines.<br>
-Clean the fermentor vessel, stirring mechanism, and other equipment thoroughly using appropriate cleaning agents and sterilize if necessary.<br>
-Properly dispose of any waste materials, such as contaminated samples or culture media, in accordance with your institution's guidelines.<br>
